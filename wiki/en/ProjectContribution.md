Project Contribution
====================

If you want to contribute as a translator please visit [Crowdin project](http://crowdin.net/project/androzic). Good knowledge of navigation terms is required.

I am also collecting map repositories for different countries. If you know some, add links in comments on the [corresponding page](MapRepositories.html).

If you are a java/c developer go to [GitHub](https://github.com/andreynovikov/Androzic).
