Tracking
========

All movement history (current track) is continuously logged in database by default. Indicator in notification area shows the status of the tracking. For memory and performance reasons Androzic shows only recent track tail. The length of a tail can be configured in Settings. You can opt to view full current track via menu but take into account that performance can degrade significantly if current track is large.
