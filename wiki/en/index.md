Androzic Wiki
=============

Androzic is an android navigation client that uses OziExplorer maps (ozf2, ozfx3). Great for hiking, geocaching, off-roading, sailing, boating and other outdoor activities. You are expected to be aware of OziExplorer or at least of where to get its maps. Maps also can be created by yourself, but with some afford, see FAQ for details.

Notice
------

[OziExplorer](OziExplorer/) authors have made their best to stop alternative projects like this. They not only recently changed the format of ozfx3 files but also included anti-debugger code in all their applications. It means that I do not know how to implement support for new ozfx3 maps. As a counteraction I have written a [OziMapper](OziMapper.html) application that gives the ability to generate ozf2 files from online map sources.
